# Testing strategy

How wanderbooks knows its books are right. Strongest oracle first: a
test's worth is where its idea of "correct" comes from, not what it runs.
Formal proofs are in `docs/verification.md`; the authorities every rule
comes from are in `docs/spec/`. Scope so far: `ledger-core` in full, and
the store in full; the import crate in progress; MCP, config, and GUI
next (gap list).

## Layers

| Layer | Oracle (rank) | Where | Command | Runtime | Gates |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Spec-derived examples | written specs with sources (1) | `tests/spec_*.rs`, `invariants.rs`, `statements.rs`, `assets.rs`, ...; the store's `tests/spec_store.rs` (written blind, from its specs only) | `just check` | seconds | every change |
| Regressions | the bug, named (1) | beside the code they cover, `*_regression`/named for the defect | `just check` | seconds | every change |
| Compatibility contracts | journals written under older rules must open (1) | `ledger-store/tests/store.rs` (`books_written_under_older_rules_still_open`) | `just check` | <1s | every change |
| Properties | laws over all inputs (2) | `properties.rs`, `spec_*.rs`, `kernel_bridge.rs` | `just check` | seconds | every change |
| Metamorphic | scaling, reversal, ordering invariance (2) | `spec_reports.rs` | `just check` | seconds | every change |
| Refusal law (store) | a refused command never reaches the journal, an accepted one always does; the live ledger equals its journal's replay in every part, and the books reopen to it (2, 3) | `store.rs` `refused_commands_never_reach_the_journal` | `just check` (`STORE_CASES=5000` deeper) | ~20s | every change |
| Fault injection (store) | a full disk or a cut-off append leaves whole, openable books (1) | `ledger-store/tests/faults.rs`, `store.rs` (`power_loss_at_any_byte_of_the_last_append_is_recovered`) | `just check` | ~5s | every change |
| Concurrency (store) | a viewer reading while the books are written sees only whole books, never a false "differs" (2) | `ledger-store/tests/concurrency.rs` | `just check` | <1s | every change |
| Model-based stateful | the Lean state machine, transcribed (3) | `tests/model.rs` | `just check` | ~3s | every change |
| Differential: Decimal vs i64 | the kernel at two types (3) | `kernel_bridge.rs` | `just check` | <1s | every change |
| Differential: GnuCash | another implementation, adjudicated (3) | `tests/oracle_gnucash.rs`, `oracle/gnucash/` | `just oracle` | ~2 min | weekly |
| Formal proofs | Kani (bounded) and Lean (unbounded) | `src/proofs.rs`, `verify/lean/` | `just prove` | ~3 min | weekly |
| Fuzzing | crash, hang, broken books (4); for `fuzz_store_replay` (validly chained journals with fuzz-chosen events): books that open must verify, and the viewer must accept exactly what the writer does | `fuzz/fuzz_targets/`, corpora in `fuzz/corpus/` | `just fuzz <target> <secs>` | 10 min each | weekly |
| Miri | undefined behavior in our use of dependencies (4) | the core's unit, bridge, invariant tests | `just miri` | ~2 min | on demand |
| Golden | `tests/golden/fixture_company.json` (5) | `invariants.rs` | `just check` | <1s | every change |
| Benchmarks | a baseline (6) | `ledger-core/benches/books.rs`, `ledger-store/benches/store.rs` | `just bench` | ~2 min | none (no budget, by decision) |
| Mutation | can the tests fail? | `ledger-core` (2026-10-13: 1,011 caught + 13 timeouts of 1,024 viable, 0 missed) | `just mutants` | ~3 h | weekly |
| Mutation (store) | can the tests fail? | `ledger-store` (2026-10-13: 357 caught + 1 timeout of 365 viable, from 82%; three of its seven survivors then killed; four equivalent left: `sort_value`'s two arms, `OpenFlags` `|` vs `^`, the long form of a sweepless close) | `just mutants-store` | ~12 min | weekly |
| Mutation (import) | can the tests fail? | `ledger-import` (2026-10-13: from 91 of 171 (53%) to 208 of 239 viable on the full run; the 31 survivors (XLSX layout, borders, alignment, exact-text grouping, IIF transliteration, tax-summary optional sections, day-equals-month dates) then killed by targeted tests, re-run clean but one: a blank amount cell written unbordered on an unruled row, invisible, so equivalent) | `just mutants-import` | ~1 h | weekly |

CI: `.github/workflows/check.yml` runs `just check` on every push;
`scheduled.yml` runs proofs, the oracle, fuzzing, and mutation weekly.

Seeds and failure databases: proptest's `*.proptest-regressions` files
are checked in and replay on every run. The GnuCash oracle's books come
from fixed seeds (`SEED` in `oracle_gnucash.rs`). Fuzz corpora live in
`fuzz/corpus/<target>`.

Golden review: `fixture_company.json` is hand-verified (docs/oracle.md,
Layer 1). The van depreciation golden was replaced on 2026-10-13 by a
hand computation (`van_schedule_is_the_hand_computed_one`) after every
row was checked against it.

## Benchmarks (baseline 2026-10-13)

No budget, by decision (the owner, 2026-10-13: the books do little work
and are fast enough). The numbers are a baseline to spot a regression.

40-account chart, two-line entries across a year, on the development
laptop:

| | 1k entries | 10k entries |
|---|---|---|
| clone the ledger (store rehearsal, per command) | 56 µs | 1.0 ms |
| post one more entry | 1.0 µs | 5.8 µs |
| trial balance | 44 µs | 1.07 ms |
| balance sheet | 47 µs | 1.04 ms |
| one month's P&L | 25 µs | 248 µs |

The store, 10k two-line entries on the laptop's disk (every journal
append is synced; `benches/store.rs` in ledger-store):

| | 10k entries |
|---|---|
| open the books (verify the chain, replay, catch the database up) | 249 ms |
| the viewer loading them | 616 ms |
| a full verify (replay, projection, every table) | 809 ms |
| post one entry (create, two lines, post: four synced appends) | 62 ms |

## Formerly assumed: checked against the standards (2026-10-13)

The owner isn't an accountant and won't adjudicate these; each was checked
against published sources instead (rank: FASB ASC via the Deloitte DART
reproduction, SEC, IRS; then textbooks; software practice is evidence of
convention only). Verdicts: CONFIRMED (a source supports it), CONVENTION
(no standard governs; matches mainstream practice), DESIGN (not an
accounting question), CHANGE (a source says otherwise; work pending).

| # | Behavior | Verdict | Source / note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | A P&L whose start is after its end is refused | DESIGN | No standard governs a reversed range; refusing beats silently swapping a typo |
| 2 | A balance sheet omits zero-balance accounts | CONFIRMED | Reg. S-X 210.4-03(a): "No caption should be shown ... as to which the items and conditions are not present." A comparative statement must still show a zero beside a non-zero prior column |
| 3 | The lifetime `profit_and_loss` counts closing entries | CONFIRMED | Used as earnings not yet closed on the balance sheet; closed income is already in capital (OpenStax Principles of Financial Accounting 5.1). Renamed `unclosed_earnings` (2026-10-14) |
| 4 | Closing a period with nothing to close still locks it | CONVENTION | A close is a lock (B-12); a dormant month must still lock and count for close-in-order |
| 5 | Draws and distributions are closed into capital at period end | CONFIRMED | OpenStax 5.1: dividends "are closed to the permanent account"; drawing accounts close to owner's capital. Monthly closes mean the year's K-1 Item L withdrawals sum across months |
| 6 | Reconciliation balances | CONFIRMED | Signed by the account's normal side (a card reads as owed), as statements show it; `reconciling_a_card_reads_its_normal_side_...` |
| 7 | A member's ending on one equity statement may differ by a cent from the next statement's beginning | CHANGED 2026-10-13 | A capital account is one running balance (Form 1065 K-1 instructions, Item L). Undistributed earnings now split cumulatively as of each date, so each member's capital chains exactly (`each_members_capital_chains_across_statements`; it fails on the old code); rules.md B-13 |
| 8 | Cash flow nets one line per account; investing comes only from registered assets | CHANGED 2026-10-13 | ASC 230-10-45-7: gross receipts and payments "more relevant" than net; 45-8 limits netting to quick-turnover items. Financing and investing are now gross; loans made and investments bought are investing (230-10-20, 45-13) via `[books] investing_accounts`. Owner-advanced expenses: PwC 6.9.3.1 constructive treatment via `[books] financing_accounts` (rules.md B-14) |
| 9 | An asset's life ends at purchase + life months, that day not held; day-count proration | CONVENTION | Exactly N months of service; day proration and the mid-month convention are both accepted book policies (ASC 360-10-35-4 not read: login) |
| 10 | A payroll entry has one line per account total | CONFIRMED | The per-employee detail the IRS requires ("Amounts and dates of all wage ... payments", Employment Tax Recordkeeping) is kept in the run; a summary entry is standard |
| 11 | A period with exactly the dates of an existing one is allowed | DESIGN | Nothing governs duplicate periods; harmless (the second close locks only). Refusing exact duplicates is an option |
| 12 | Each close into members' capital rounds on its own (ties to the earlier member) | CHANGED 2026-10-13 | Twelve monthly 50/50 closes could leave one member several cents ahead. A run of members closes now splits cumulatively (rules.md B-13; Lean `runPart_telescopes`; property `each_member_stays_within_a_cent_of_their_share` fails on the per-close rule); journaled `"cumulative"`, older closes replay as booked |

Questions are settled from the sources, not by any one company's CPA
(wanderbooks is general software). Where the standards leave a real
choice, it is a per-company setting with a sourced default, for that
company's accountant to review: the cash flow account roles (rules.md
B-14) are the first.

## Gap list: what isn't covered, and what would bring it in

| Technique | Status | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Fault injection | SKIP for the core (no I/O, clock, or network); DONE for the store's journal (full disk, cut-off append) | the first I/O or clock in `ledger-core` |
| Integration | SKIP for the core (no collaborators) | the core gains one; covered at the store and MCP layers |
| End-to-end | SKIP for the core (a library) | MCP stdio tests cover the journeys |
| Security properties | SKIP for the core (no roles, no secrets) | the first permission concept, or a secret-bearing field |
| Concurrency stress | SKIP for the core (no shared state); DONE for the store's writer + viewer (found the false "differs") | the first `Arc`, atomic, or lock in the core; the MCP server's HTTP transport shares one store across sessions (next) |
| Lean: apportion's sum law for any n | OPEN | Kani covers n <= 3, properties n <= 5; needs a permutation lemma |
| ASC paragraphs not yet read | OPEN | ASC 360-10-35-4, 340-10, 230-10-45-10, 606-10-55-37B, 210: needs a FASB basic-view login |
| GnuCash's own close | OPEN | the oracle books closes as ordinary entries; comparing GnuCash's Close Book needs its Scheme API |
| Import: spec-blind suite, footing properties, mutation | DONE | sources vendored (Intuit bank CSV and IIF, ECMA-376/Excel numbers, IRS form lines); specs on every module; tests/spec_import.rs (spec-blind, footing and round-trip properties, XLSX read back from its XML, layout and styles); fuzz_import_csv; templates checked against the engine's control accounts; mutation one equivalent left |
| MCP, config, GUI crates | NEXT | the same playbook |
