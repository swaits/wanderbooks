# Testing strategy

How wanderbooks knows its books are right. Strongest oracle first: a
test's worth is where its idea of "correct" comes from, not what it runs.
Formal proofs are in `docs/verification.md`; the authorities every rule
comes from are in `docs/spec/`. Scope so far: `ledger-core` in full, and
the store's journal safety; the other crates come next (gap list).

## Layers

| Layer | Oracle (rank) | Where | Command | Runtime | Gates |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Spec-derived examples | written specs with sources (1) | `tests/spec_*.rs`, `invariants.rs`, `statements.rs`, `assets.rs`, ... | `just check` | seconds | every change |
| Regressions | the bug, named (1) | beside the code they cover, `*_regression`/named for the defect | `just check` | seconds | every change |
| Compatibility contracts | journals written under older rules must open (1) | `ledger-store/tests/store.rs` (`books_written_under_older_rules_still_open`) | `just check` | <1s | every change |
| Properties | laws over all inputs (2) | `properties.rs`, `spec_*.rs`, `kernel_bridge.rs` | `just check` | seconds | every change |
| Metamorphic | scaling, reversal, ordering invariance (2) | `spec_reports.rs` | `just check` | seconds | every change |
| Refusal law (store) | a refused command never reaches the journal; the books reopen to the same reports (2, 3) | `store.rs` `refused_commands_never_reach_the_journal` | `just check` (`STORE_CASES=5000` deeper) | ~20s | every change |
| Fault injection (store) | a full disk or a cut-off append leaves whole, openable books (1) | `ledger-store/tests/faults.rs`, `store.rs` (`power_loss_at_any_byte_of_the_last_append_is_recovered`) | `just check` | ~5s | every change |
| Model-based stateful | the Lean state machine, transcribed (3) | `tests/model.rs` | `just check` | ~3s | every change |
| Differential: Decimal vs i64 | the kernel at two types (3) | `kernel_bridge.rs` | `just check` | <1s | every change |
| Differential: GnuCash | another implementation, adjudicated (3) | `tests/oracle_gnucash.rs`, `oracle/gnucash/` | `just oracle` | ~2 min | weekly |
| Formal proofs | Kani (bounded) and Lean (unbounded) | `src/proofs.rs`, `verify/lean/` | `just prove` | ~3 min | weekly |
| Fuzzing | crash, hang, broken books (4) | `fuzz/fuzz_targets/`, corpora in `fuzz/corpus/` | `just fuzz <target> <secs>` | 10 min each | weekly |
| Miri | undefined behavior in our use of dependencies (4) | the core's unit, bridge, invariant tests | `just miri` | ~2 min | on demand |
| Golden | `tests/golden/fixture_company.json` (5) | `invariants.rs` | `just check` | <1s | every change |
| Benchmarks | a baseline (6) | `benches/books.rs` | `just bench` | ~1 min | none (no budget, by decision) |
| Mutation | can the tests fail? | `ledger-core` (2026-10-13: 1,011 caught + 13 timeouts of 1,024 viable, 0 missed) | `just mutants` | ~3 h | weekly |

CI: `.github/workflows/check.yml` runs `just check` on every push;
`scheduled.yml` runs proofs, the oracle, fuzzing, and mutation weekly.

Seeds and failure databases: proptest's `*.proptest-regressions` files
are checked in and replay on every run. The GnuCash oracle's books come
from fixed seeds (`SEED` in `oracle_gnucash.rs`). Fuzz corpora live in
`fuzz/corpus/<target>`.

Golden review: `fixture_company.json` is hand-verified (docs/oracle.md,
Layer 1). The van depreciation golden was replaced on 2026-10-13 by a
hand computation (`van_schedule_is_the_hand_computed_one`) after every
row was checked against it.

## Benchmarks (baseline 2026-10-13)

No budget, by decision (the owner, 2026-10-13: the books do little work
and are fast enough). The numbers are a baseline to spot a regression.

40-account chart, two-line entries across a year, on the development
laptop:

| | 1k entries | 10k entries |
|---|---|---|
| clone the ledger (store rehearsal, per command) | 56 µs | 1.0 ms |
| post one more entry | 1.0 µs | 5.8 µs |
| trial balance | 44 µs | 1.07 ms |
| balance sheet | 47 µs | 1.04 ms |
| one month's P&L | 25 µs | 248 µs |

## Formerly assumed: checked against the standards (2026-10-13)

The owner isn't an accountant and won't adjudicate these; each was checked
against published sources instead (rank: FASB ASC via the Deloitte DART
reproduction, SEC, IRS; then textbooks; software practice is evidence of
convention only). Verdicts: CONFIRMED (a source supports it), CONVENTION
(no standard governs; matches mainstream practice), DESIGN (not an
accounting question), CHANGE (a source says otherwise; work pending).

| # | Behavior | Verdict | Source / note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | A P&L whose start is after its end is refused | DESIGN | No standard governs a reversed range; refusing beats silently swapping a typo |
| 2 | A balance sheet omits zero-balance accounts | CONFIRMED | Reg. S-X 210.4-03(a): "No caption should be shown ... as to which the items and conditions are not present." A comparative statement must still show a zero beside a non-zero prior column |
| 3 | The lifetime `profit_and_loss` counts closing entries | CONFIRMED | Used as earnings not yet closed on the balance sheet; closed income is already in capital (OpenStax Principles of Financial Accounting 5.1). Its name misleads: rename to unclosed earnings (pending) |
| 4 | Closing a period with nothing to close still locks it | CONVENTION | A close is a lock (B-12); a dormant month must still lock and count for close-in-order |
| 5 | Draws and distributions are closed into capital at period end | CONFIRMED | OpenStax 5.1: dividends "are closed to the permanent account"; drawing accounts close to owner's capital. Monthly closes mean the year's K-1 Item L withdrawals sum across months |
| 6 | Reconciliation balances | CONFIRMED | Signed by the account's normal side (a card reads as owed), as statements show it; `reconciling_a_card_reads_its_normal_side_...` |
| 7 | A member's ending on one equity statement may differ by a cent from the next statement's beginning | CHANGE (pending) | A capital account is one running balance (Form 1065 K-1 instructions, Item L: beginning and ending capital "based on the partnership's books and records"). Allocate cumulatively so beginning equals the prior ending per member. CPA question below |
| 8 | Cash flow nets one line per account; investing comes only from registered assets | CHANGE (pending) | ASC 230-10-45-7: gross receipts and payments "more relevant" than net; 45-8 limits netting to quick-turnover items. Financing: contributions apart from distributions, borrowings apart from repayments. ASC 230-10-20/45-13: loans made and investments bought are investing, so classify by account role |
| 9 | An asset's life ends at purchase + life months, that day not held; day-count proration | CONVENTION | Exactly N months of service; day proration and the mid-month convention are both accepted book policies (ASC 360-10-35-4 not read: login) |
| 10 | A payroll entry has one line per account total | CONFIRMED | The per-employee detail the IRS requires ("Amounts and dates of all wage ... payments", Employment Tax Recordkeeping) is kept in the run; a summary entry is standard |
| 11 | A period with exactly the dates of an existing one is allowed | DESIGN | Nothing governs duplicate periods; harmless (the second close locks only). Refusing exact duplicates is an option |

Questions for the CPA (CPA):

1. Interim members' equity: is a per-member allocation of unclosed
   earnings acceptable on interim statements, or should the books close
   monthly so the capital accounts carry it?
2. How should 2100 Due to Shareholders, and expenses the owners paid
   personally, appear on the cash flow statement: operating, financing,
   or as a non-cash disclosure (ASC 230-10-50-3, not yet read)?

## Gap list: what isn't covered, and what would bring it in

| Technique | Status | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Fault injection | SKIP for the core (no I/O, clock, or network); DONE for the store's journal (full disk, cut-off append) | the first I/O or clock in `ledger-core` |
| Integration | SKIP for the core (no collaborators) | the core gains one; covered at the store and MCP layers |
| End-to-end | SKIP for the core (a library) | MCP stdio tests cover the journeys |
| Security properties | SKIP for the core (no roles, no secrets) | the first permission concept, or a secret-bearing field |
| Concurrency stress | SKIP for the core (no shared state) | the first `Arc`, atomic, or lock in the core; the GUI and MCP server have threads (next) |
| Lean: apportion's sum law for any n | OPEN | Kani covers n <= 3, properties n <= 5; needs a permutation lemma |
| ASC paragraphs not yet read | OPEN | ASC 360-10-35-4, 340-10, 230-10-45-10, 606-10-55-37B, 210: needs a FASB basic-view login |
| GnuCash's own close | OPEN | the oracle books closes as ordinary entries; comparing GnuCash's Close Book needs its Scheme API |
| Store: differential replay vs. projection, concurrency (writer + snapshot reader), benchmarks at 10k, mutation | NEXT | then import, MCP, config, GUI, the same playbook |
